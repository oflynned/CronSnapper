# CronSnapper

Play a small prank on someone by getting this script to be run. It's invoked every 30 mins if a get request to a server returns the field ```{should_run: true}```, speaks to the user, takes a picture, shows it, and then displays a notification of data polled from a remote server.
Doesn't require root access or for any libraries to be downloaded. Future work may be embedding this in a small program for another use.
